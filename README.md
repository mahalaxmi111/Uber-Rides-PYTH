# Uber Rides Data Analysis

This project analyzes Uber Rides data to uncover key insights about ride purposes, peak hours, distance preferences, and seasonal trends. The analysis leverages Python and popular libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## **Project Overview**
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleansing and transforming data to prepare for analysis.
- **Visualizations**: Using Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize patterns.
- **Insights**: Deriving actionable insights based on ride categories, peak hours, distance trends, and seasonality.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python Libraries**:
The analysis is performed using the following libraries:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For data visualization.

- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE.

## Data Analysis

The analysis includes:
- Importing necessary libraries.
- Loading the dataset containing ride details such as `START_DATE`, `END_DATE`, `CATEGORY`, `START`, `STOP`, `MILES`, and `PURPOSE`.
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to summarize and visualize ride patterns.

## Visualizations

Visualizations are created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to illustrate findings from the data analysis. These may include:
- Histograms of ride frequencies.
- Line charts showing trends over time.
- Bar charts comparing different ride categories.
